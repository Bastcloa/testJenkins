The following article is a '''comparison of aerobic and [[anaerobic digestion]]'''. In both [[Aerobic_organism|aerobic]] and anaerobic systems the growing and reproducing microorganisms within them require a source of elemental oxygen to survive.<ref name="Aerobic and anaerobic respiration">[http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~terry/Common/respiration.swf Aerobic and anaerobic respiration], www.sp.uconn.edu, retrieved 24.10.07</ref>

In an anaerobic system there is an absence of gaseous oxygen. In an anaerobic digester, gaseous oxygen is prevented from entering the system through physical containment in sealed tanks. Anaerobes access oxygen from sources other than the surrounding air. The oxygen source for these microorganisms can be the organic material itself or alternatively may be supplied by inorganic [[oxide]]s from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, then the 'intermediate' end products are primarily [[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[organic acid]]s plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide with trace levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]].<ref>''Adapted from'' Beychok, M. (1967) [[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]], First edition, John Wiley & Sons, [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]</ref> In an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.<ref name="Fergusen, T. 2006 p49">Fergusen, T. & Mah, R. (2006) Methanogenic bacteria in Anaerobic digestion of biomass, p49</ref>

In an aerobic system, such as [[composting]], the microorganisms access free, gaseous oxygen directly from the surrounding atmosphere. The end products of an aerobic process are primarily carbon dioxide and water which are the stable, [[oxidised]] forms of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]]. If the biodegradable starting material contains [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], then the end products may also include their oxidised forms- [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[sulfate]].<ref name="Aerobic and anaerobic respiration"/> In an aerobic system the majority of the energy in the starting material is released as heat by their oxidisation into carbon dioxide and water.<ref name="Fergusen, T. 2006 p49"/> 

Composting systems typically include organisms such as [[fungi]] that are able to break down [[lignin]] and [[cellulose]]s to a greater extent than anaerobic bacteria.<ref>[http://www.css.cornell.edu/compost/calc/lignin.html The effect of lignin on biodegradability], www.css.cornell.edu, retrieved 2.11.07</ref> Due to this fact it is possible, following anaerobic digestion, to compost the anaerobic digestate allowing further volume reduction and stabilisation.<ref>[http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/anaerobic_digestion.pdf Anaerobic digestion briefing], www.foe.co.uk, retrieved 2.11.07</ref>
