The [[embedded system|embedded]] [[computer system]]s on board the [[Mars rover]]s sent by [[NASA]] must withstand the high radiation levels and large temperature changes in space. For this reason their computational resources are limited compared to systems commonly used on Earth.<ref name="ieeecomputer">[[Max Bajracharya]], [[Mark W. Maimone]], and [[Daniel Helmick]] (2008) ([[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and [[California Institute of Technology]]); ''Autonomy for Mars rovers: past, present, and future''; published in: ''[[Computer (journal)|Computer]]'', a [[academic journal|journal]] of the [[IEEE]] [[IEEE Computer Society|Computer Society]], December 2008, Volume 41, Number 12, page 45, [[ISSN]] 0018-9162.</ref>

== In operation ==
Direct [[teleoperation]] of a Mars rover is impractical, since the round trip communication time between Earth and Mars ranges from 8 to 42 minutes and the [[Deep Space Network]] system is only available a few times during each Martian day ([[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sol]]).<ref name="ieeecomputer"/> Therefore a rover command team plans, then sends, a sol of operational commands to the rover at one time.<ref name="ieeecomputer"/>

A rover uses [[autonomy]] [[computer software|software]] to make decisions based on observations from its sensors.<ref name="ieeecomputer"/> Each pair of images for stereo the [[Mars Pathfinder#Sojourner rover|Sojourner]] rover could generate 20 navigation 3D points (with the initial software version the craft landed with). The [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] rovers can generate 15,000 (nominal) to 40,000 (survey mode) 3D points.<ref name="ieeecomputer"/>

==Performance comparisons==

With the exception of Curiosity, each Mars rover has only one on-board computer. There are two identical on-board computers on Curiosity, which is currently operating on its redundant computer, while its primary computer is being investigated for the reasons why it started to fail.
