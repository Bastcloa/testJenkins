Several Asian countries have [[List of space agencies|space programs]] and are actively competing to achieve scientific and technological advancements in [[outer space|space]], a situation sometimes referred to as the '''Asian space race''' in the popular media<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/160037 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> as a reference to the earlier [[Space Race]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. Like the previous space race, issues involved in the current push to space include [[national security]], which has spurred many countries to send artificial [[satellite|satellites]] as well as [[human spaceflight|humans]] into [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]] and beyond.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> A number of Asian countries are seen as contenders in the ongoing race to be the pre-eminent power in space.<ref>{{cite web| title = Asia Nations Gaining Ground in Space Race| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070517-voa01.htm}}</ref>

==Asian space powers==
{{See also|Timeline of first orbital launches by country}} 

Of the ten countries that have independently [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|successfully launched a satellite into orbit]], six are Asian: [[China]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]] and [[North Korea]].

China's first manned spacecraft entered orbit in October 2003, making China the first Asian nation to [[human spaceflight|send a human]] into space.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news

After successful achievement of [[geostationary]] technology, India's [[ISRO]] launched its first  Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-1]], which discovered [[Lunar water|ice water on the Moon]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Heated Space Race Under Way in Asia| url = http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3041588}} ABC News</ref> India launched on 5 November 2013 its maiden interplanetary mission, the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]]. The primary objective is to determine Mars' atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane. The spacecraft completed its journey on 24 September, 2014 when it  entered its intended orbit around Mars, making India the first Asian country to successfully place a Mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt. India became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to Mars.

In addition to increasing national pride, countries are commercially motivated to operate in space. Commercial satellites are launched for communications, weather forecasting, and atmospheric research. According to a report by the [[Space Frontier Foundation]] released in 2006, the "space economy" is estimated to be worth about $180&nbsp;billion, with more than 60% of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news

===China===
{{Main|Chinese space program}} 
China has a space program with an independent [[human spaceflight]] capability. It has developed a sizable family of successful [[Long March rockets]]. It has launched two lunar orbiters, [[Chang'e 1]] and [[Chang'e 2]]. On 2 December 2013 China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, China's [[Chang'e 3]] Moon lander and its rover Yutu toward the Moon.<ref>Leonard David Space.com</ref> It also has plans to land a rover on the Moon to retrieve samples. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned [[space station]], starting with the launch of [[Tiangong 1]]. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter ([[Yinghuo-1]]) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news

Some analysts suggest that the Chinese space program is linked to the nation's efforts at developing advanced military technology.<ref>{{cite web
 | title = China's man in space gets mixed reaction
 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4276-chinas-man-in-space-gets-mixed-reaction.html}}</ref>

China's advanced technology is the result of the integration of various related technological experiences. Early Chinese satellites, such as the [[Fanhui Shi Weixing|FSW]] series, have undergone many [[atmospheric reentry]] tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration. China's Shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] in September 2008. China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in June 2012. Furthermore, China's Chang'e 2 explorer became the first object to reach Sun-Earth Langrangian point in August 2011. On 13 December 2012, [[Chang'e 2]] flew by asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]] successfully, becoming the first probe to orbit the Moon, orbit the Lissajous orbit at Sun-Earth [[Langrangian point]] and fly by an asteroid at the closest distance of 3.2&nbsp;km .

===Japan===

The Japanese space shuttle [[HOPE-X]], to be launched by the conventional space launcher [[H-II]], was developed but the program was postponed and eventually cancelled. Then the simpler manned capsule [[Fuji (Spacecraft)|Fuji]] was proposed but not adopted. Pioneer projects of [[Single stage to orbit|single-stage to orbit]], [[RLV|reusable launch vehicle]] horizontal takeoff and landing ASSTS and [[VTOL|vertical takeoff and landing]] [[Kankoh-maru]] were developed but have not been adopted. A more conservative new ([[JAXA|JAXA manned spacecraft]]) project is proposed to launch by 2025 as part of the Japanese plan to send manned missions to the Moon. [[:ja:松浦晋也|Shin'ya Matsuura]] is doubtful about the Japanese manned Moon project, and suspects the project is a euphemism for participation in the American [[Constellation program]].<ref name="nikkeibp">{{cite web| url=http://www.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/column/20090309/137495/|script-title=ja:浮上した日本の有人月探査計画（1） |publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications |Nikkei BP]]| language=Japanese}}</ref> JAXA planned to send a [[humanoid robot]] (such as [[ASIMO]]) to the Moon.<ref name="nikkeibp" />{{when|date=October 2014}}

India has gained significant expertise in space technologies and has successfully conducted many commercial launches. In 2008, India set a record by launching 10 satellites simultaneously.<ref name="10 Satellite launch" /><ref name="PSLV satellite launch"/> The mission of [[Moon Impact Probe|MIP]], the first Asian probe designed for lunar impact was also completed in the same year. On 5 November 2013, India successfully launched the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]], also informally called "Mangalyaan", which successfully entered into the orbit around Mars on 24 September, 2014. India is the first country in Asia and fourth in the world to perform a successful Mars mission, and the only one to do so on the first attempt.  The mission was completed at a record cost of $74 million.<ref>http://www.btvin.com/videos/watch/8916/india%E2%80%99s-maiden-mars-mission-makes-history</ref> Till date India has launched as many as 41 foreign satellites in about 27 launches (with 100% success rate) using its workhorse [[PSLV]] launch vehicles.

==Other minor players==

===Iran=== 
{{Main|Iranian Space Agency}}
[[File:Simorgh SLV.png|thumb|100px|Iranian [[Simorgh (rocket)]] SLV]]
Iran has developed its own satellite launch vehicle, named the [[Safir (rocket)|Safir]] SLV, based on the [[Shahab-1|Shahab]] series of [[IRBM]]s. On 2 February 2009, Iranian state television reported that Iran's first domestically made satellite [[Omid]] (from the Persian امید, meaning "Hope") had been successfully launched into [[low Earth orbit]] by a version of Iran's Safir rocket, the Safir-2.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5120NN20090203 | work=Reuters | title=Iran launches satellite; U.S. expresses concern | date=2009-02-03}}</ref> The launch coincided with the 30th anniversary of the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Iran is also developing a new launch vehicle [[Simorgh (rocket)]].

===Israel=== 
{{Main|Israel Space Agency}}
Israel became the tenth country in the world to build its own satellite and launch it with its own launcher on 19 September 1988. Israel launched its first satellite, [[Ofeq]]-1, using an Israeli-built [[Shavit]] three-stage launch vehicle.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/worldspace/israel.html |title=Israel in Space Program |publisher=Aerospaceguide.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref> The launching was the high point of a process that began in 1983 with the establishment of the [[Israel Space Agency]] under the aegis of the Ministry of Science. Space research by university-based scientists began in the 1960s, providing a ready-made pool of experts for Israel's foray into space. Since then, local universities, research institutes, and private industry, backed by the Israel Space Agency, have made progress in space technology. The agency's role is to support "private and academic space projects, coordinate their efforts, initiate and develop international relations and projects, head integrative projects involving different bodies, and create public awareness for the importance of space development."<ref>http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/6/Israel-s%20Space%20Program</ref>

===North Korea===
{{Main|Korean Committee of Space Technology}} 

[[DPRK|North Korea]] has many years of experience with rocket technology, which it has passed along to Pakistan and other countries. On December 12, 2012, North Korea placed its first satellite in orbit with the launch of [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2]]. On 12 March 2009 North Korea signed the [[Outer Space Treaty]] and the [[Registration Convention]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200903/news12/20090312-11ee.html |title=KCNA Report on DPRK's Accession to International Space Treaty and Convention |publisher=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> after a previous declaration of preparations for the launch of [[Kwangmyongsong-2]]. North Korea twice announced satellite launches: [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1]] on 31 August 1998 and Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 on 5 April 2009. Neither of these claims were confirmed by the rest of the world, but the United States and South Korea believe there were tests of military ballistic missiles. The North Korean space agency is the [[Korean Committee of Space Technology]], which operates the [[Musudan-ri]] and [[Tongch'ang-dong Space Launch Center]] rocket launching sites and has developed the [[Paektusan (rocket)|Baekdusan-1]] and [[Unha|Unha (Baekdusan-2)]] space launchers and [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng programme|Kwangmyŏngsŏng]] satellites. In 2009 North Korea announced several future space projects, including manned space flights and the development of a manned partially reusable launch vehicle.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.minzuwang.com/inc/news_view.asp?newsid=12503 |title =朝鲜宣布发展太空计划抗衡"西方强权" |publisher=[[Rodong Sinmun]] |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref>

==Solar System exploration==
[[Timeline of Solar System exploration|Solar System exploration]] and manned spaceflights are major space technologies in the public eye. Since [[Sakigake]], the first interplanetary probe in Asia, was launched in 1985, Japan has completed the most planetary exploration, but other nations are catching up.

===Moon race===
The Moon is thought to be rich in [[Helium-3]], which could one day be used in [[Fusion power|nuclear fusion power plants]] to fuel future [[World energy resources and consumption|energy demands]] in Asia. All three main Asian space powers plan to send men to the Moon in the distant future and have already sent [[Robotic spacecraft#Lunar probes|lunar probes]].

====Probing the Moon====
Japan was the first Asian country to launch a lunar probe. The [[Hiten]] (Japanese: "flying angel") spacecraft (known before the launch as Muses-A), built by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of Japan, was launched on 24 January 1990. In many ways, the mission did not go as was planned. [[SELENE|Kaguya]], the second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft, was launched on 14 September 2007.

China launched its first lunar probe, [[Chang'e-1]], on 24 October 2007 and successfully entered lunar orbit on 5 November 2007.

India launched its first lunar probe, [[Chandrayaan-1]], on 22 October 2008 and successfully entered its final lunar orbit on 2 November 2008. The mission was considered a major success and the probe detected water on the lunar surface.

====Moon landings====
{{Main|Moon landing}}
The first confirmed Moon landing from Asia was Hiten's mission in 1993. An intentional hard landing at the end of the mission, some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isas.ac.jp/j/isasnews/backnumber/1994/ISASnews154.pdf|title=ISAS news No.154|language=Japanese|format=PDF}}</ref> Hiten was not designed as a Moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration. The next Japanese Moon landing program was the [[LUNAR-A]], developed from 1992. Although the LUNAR-A orbiter was cancelled, its penetrators are integrated into the Russian [[Luna-Glob]] program, which was scheduled to launch in 2011. The penetrators are "relatively" hard landers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/lunar_a/index_e.html|title=Lunar exploration satellite "LUNAR-A"}}</ref> but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.

The first Asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the Indian [[Moon Impact Probe]] (MIP) released from [[Chandrayaan-1]] in 2008. MIP was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing test will be applied to future soft landings such as [[Chandrayaan-2]], planned for 2016.

The Chinese Chang'e-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009, when China became the sixth country to reach the lunar surface. One purpose of the lander was to pre-test for future soft landings. A Chinese lunar soft lander is achieved with the Chang'e-3 mission.

===Exploration of the major planets===
Japanese interplanetary probes have been limited to [[Small Solar System bodies]] such as [[comets]] and [[asteroids]]. JAXA's [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi probe]] was launched in 1998, but contact was lost with the probe due to electrical failures before visiting the planet Mars. The second Japanese probe for the planet Venus, [[Akatsuki (probe)|Akatsuki]], was launched in 2010 but has failed as for now.

Chinese scientists expect that China will take 20&nbsp;years to launch independent planetary probes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zjdaily.zjol.com.cn/html/2009-06/08/content_4869055.htm|script-title=zh:中国自主探测火星还需20年|publisher=浙江日报|language=Chinese|date=2009-06-08|accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref> The Chinese manned Mars exploration program is planned for around 2050 by the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordchina.co.jp/group/g32328.html|script-title=ja:2050年頃に有人火星探査を実施＝中国科学院が計画を発表―中国|publisher=Recoed China|language=Jananese|date=2009-06-10|accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>

India has successfully launched [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] on November 5, 2013. It reached Mars on September 2014. India has become the only country to successfully insert a satellite into Martian orbit in its maiden attempt; it also became the first Asian country to achieve this feat.
