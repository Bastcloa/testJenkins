The following is a list of '''[[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[microarchitecture]]s'''.

==x86 microarchitectures==
* [[AMD K5]] - AMD's first original microarchitecture. The K5 was based on the [[AMD Am29000]] micro architecture with the addition of an x86 decoder. Although the design was similar in idea to a [[Pentium Pro]], the actual performance was more like that of a [[Intel P5|Pentium]].
* [[AMD K6]] - The K6 was not based on the K5 and was instead based on the Nx686 processor that was being designed by [[NexGen]] when that company was bought by AMD. The K6 was generally pin-compatible with the Intel Pentium (unlike NexGen's existing processors).
** [[AMD K6-2]] - An improved K6 with the addition of the [[3DNow!]] [[SIMD]] instructions.
** [[AMD K6-III]] - A further improved K6 with three levels of [[CPU cache|cache]] â€“ 64&nbsp;KB L1, 256&nbsp;KB full-speed on-die L2, and a variable (up to 2&nbsp;MB) L3.
* [[AMD K7]] - Microarchitecture of the AMD [[Athlon|Athlon classic]] and [[Athlon XP]] [[microprocessors]]. Was a very advanced design for its day.
* [[AMD K8]] - based on the ''K7'' but was extended to [[x86-64|64 bits]], added an integrated [[memory controller]], [[HyperTransport]] communication fabric, [[L2 cache]] sizes up to 1&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] (1128&nbsp;KB total cache), and [[SSE2]]. Later ''K8'' added [[SSE3]]. The K8 was the first mainstream [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-compatible 64-bit microprocessor and was released April 22, 2003. K8 replaced the traditional [[front side bus]] with a [[HyperTransport]] communication fabric. Also known as AMD Family&nbsp;15. ''SledgeHammer'' was the first design which implemented it.
* [[AMD K10]] - based on the ''K8 microarchitecture''. Shared Level 3 Cache, 128-bit [[floating point]] units, [[AMD-V Nested Paging]] [[Hardware-assisted virtualization|virtualization]], and HyperTransport 3.0 are introduced. ''Barcelona'' was the first design which implemented it.
* [[AMD Fusion]] - Include CPU cores, [[Graphics processing unit]] and [[Northbridge]] in the same chip. ''Llano'' was the first design which implemented it.
* [[AMD Bobcat]] - a new distinct line, which is aimed in the 1&nbsp;[[watt|W]] to 10&nbsp;W power microprocessor category. ''Ontario'' and ''Zacate'' were the first designs which implemented it.
** [[Jaguar (microarchitecture)|Jaguar]] - Successor to Bobcat. Kabini and Temash.
** [[Puma (microarchitecture)|Puma]] - Successor to Jaguar. Beema and Mullins.
* [[AMD Bulldozer]] - the successor of K10. Bulldozer is designed for processors in the 10&nbsp;[[Watt|W]] to 220&nbsp;W category, implementing [[XOP instruction set|XOP]], [[FMA4 instruction set|FMA4]] and [[CVT16 instruction set|CVT16]] instruction sets. ''Orochi'' was the first design which implemented it.
** [[Piledriver (microarchitecture)|Piledriver]]
** [[Steamroller (microarchitecture)|Steamroller]]
** [[Excavator (microarchitecture)|Excavator]]
* [[AMD Zen]] - the successor of Bulldozer.

==Other microarchitectures==
* [[AMD Am2900|AMD Am2900 microarchitecture]] - [[Bit-slice]] architecture designed in 1975.
* [[AMD Am29000|AMD Am29000 microarchitecture]] - Popular line of 32-bit [[RISC]] [[microprocessors]] and [[microcontrollers]].
* [[AMD K12]]
