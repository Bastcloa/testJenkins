This is a partial, non-exhaustive list of '''[[Online dating service|online dating]] [[website]]s'''.

<!-- IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THIS MESSAGE, YOUR EDIT WILL BE ROLLED BACK WITHOUT WARNING.

ONLY place entries here that are links to actual Wikipedia articles about notable dating networking sites. External links, redlinks, substubs, non-notable sites or sites that are not dating sites will be removed. If you have questions, use the talk page. Please try to keep entries in alphabetical order. Adding unnecessary links or text anywhere else will also be removed. Thanks.

Please see "WP:WEB" for information on notability for websites on Wikipedia.
Editors are encouraged to write the article first (See "WP:WTAF").

Do not even think of putting 'number of users' without providing a recent, CITED number (WITHOUT COMMAS). Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of fact not of guessed numbers, or numbers several years out of date. The number MUST match any number cited in the WP article on the site itself! It is not desirable for the site itself to be given as a source given such numbers may be artificially inflated.

Please use {{nts}} and ***NO COMMAS*** for the user counts so they do not mess up sorting. Commas are automatically added.

For example: {{nts|1234567}}
Use {{ntsh}} with non-numeric user counts, for example:
{{ntsh|0}}Unknown
{{ntsh|1000}}Thousands 

Please only add a sortable table if it puts e.g. all "millions" above all "thousands". Refer to talk page for consensus on this. Also, please make sure the numbers shown on the table are "registered users" not "visitors". -->
