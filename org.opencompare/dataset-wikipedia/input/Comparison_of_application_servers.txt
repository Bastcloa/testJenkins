[[Application server]]s are system software upon which [[web application]]s or desktop applications run. Application Servers consist of web server connectors, computer [[programming language]]s, [[runtime library|runtime libraries]], database connectors, and the administration code needed to deploy, configure, manage, and connect these components on a web host. An application server runs behind a [[web Server]] (e.g. [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] or [[Internet Information Services|Microsoft IIS]]) and (almost always) in front of an [[SQL|SQL database]] (e.g. [[PostgreSQL]], [[MySQL]] or [[Oracle Database|Oracle]]). Web applications are computer code which run on top of application servers and are written in the language(s) the application server supports and call the runtime libraries and components the application server offers.

There are many application servers and the choice impacts the cost, performance, reliability, scalability, and maintainability of a web application.

Proprietary application servers provide system services in a well-defined but proprietary manner. The application developers develop programs according to the specification of the application server. Dependence on a particular vendor is the drawback of this approach.

An opposite but analogous case is the [[Java EE]] platform discussed below.

Java EE application servers provide system services in a well-defined, open, industry standard. The application developers develop programs according to the Java EE specification and not according to the application server.

A Java EE application developed according to Java EE standard can be deployed in any Java EE application server making it vendor independent.

This article compares the features and functionality of application servers, grouped by the hosting environment that is offered by that particular application server.

== BASIC ==
* [[Run BASIC]] - An all-in-one BASIC scriptable application server, can automatically manage session and state

== C ==
* [[Appaserver]]

== C++ ==
* [[Tuxedo (software)|Tuxedo]] - Based on the ATMI standard, is one of the original application servers.
* [[Tntnet]] - Includes a template engine which allows embedding C++ code in HTML pages. Templates are compiled before run-time, and thus very fast. Multi-threaded, supports object lifetime via scoped variables.
* [[CPPSERV]] - C++ servlet container.
* [[Wt (web toolkit)|Wt]] - A web toolkit similar to [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] permitting GUI-application-like web development with built-in [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] abilities.
* [[POCO C++ Libraries]] - A collection of open source class libraries including Poco.Net.HTTPServer.html
* [[CppCMS]]
* uWSGI<ref name="uWSGI doc">{{cite web |title=The uWSGI project â€” uWSGI documentation |url=http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/}}</ref>

== Erlang ==
* [[CloudI]] - Provides C/C++, Elixir/Erlang, Java, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby integration. <ref>http://cloudi.org</ref>

== Haskell ==
* [[Happstack]]
* [[Hyena (Web_Server)]]
* [[Snap (Web_Server)]]
* [[Warp (Web_Server)]]
