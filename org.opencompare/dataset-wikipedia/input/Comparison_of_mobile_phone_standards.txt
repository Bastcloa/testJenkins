A '''comparison of mobile phone standards''' can be done in many ways.

==Issues==
[[Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM, around 80–85% market share) and [[IS-95]] (around 10–15% market share) were the two most prevalent 2G mobile communication technologies in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/pdf/gsma_stats_q1_07.pdf | title = Subscriber statistics end Q1 2007 | accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927162249/http://www.gsmworld.com/news/statistics/pdf/gsma_stats_q1_07.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> In 3G, the most prevalent technology was [[UMTS]] with [[CDMA-2000]] in close contention.

All radio access technologies have to solve the same problems: to divide the finite [[RF spectrum]] among multiple users as efficiently as possible. GSM uses [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[FDMA]] for user and cell separation. UMTS, IS-95 and CDMA-2000 use [[CDMA]]. [[WiMAX]] and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] use [[OFDM]].

* [[Time division multiple access|Time-division multiple access (TDMA)]]  provides multiuser access by chopping up the channel into sequential time slices. Each user of the channel takes turns to transmit and receive signals. In reality, only one person is actually using the channel at a specific moment.  This is analogous to [[time-sharing]] on a large computer server.

* [[Frequency division multiple access|Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA)]] provides multiuser access by separating the used frequencies. This is used in GSM to separate cells, which then use TDMA to separate users within the cell.

* [[CDMA|Code-division multiple access (CDMA)]]  This uses a [[digital modulation]] called [[spread spectrum]] which spreads the voice data over a very wide channel in [[pseudorandom number|pseudorandom]] fashion using a user or cell specific pseudorandom code. The receiver undoes the randomization to collect the bits together and produce the original data. As the codes are pseudorandom and selected in such a way as to cause minimal interference to one another, multiple users can talk at the same time and multiple cells can share the same frequency. This causes an added signal noise forcing all users to use more power, which in exchange decreases cell range and battery life.

* [[Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access]] (OFDMA) uses bundling of multiple small frequency bands that are orthogonal to one another to provide for separation of users. The users are multiplexed in the frequency domain by allocating specific sub-bands to individual users. This is often enhanced by also performing TDMA and changing the allocation periodically so that different users get different sub-bands at different times.

In theory, CDMA, TDMA and FDMA have exactly the same spectral efficiency but practically, each has its own challenges – power control in the case of CDMA, timing in the case of TDMA, and frequency generation/filtering in the case of FDMA.

For a classic example for understanding the fundamental difference of TDMA and CDMA imagine a cocktail party, where couples are talking to each other in a single room.  The room represents the available bandwidth: 

:TDMA: A speaker takes turns talking to a listener. The speaker talks for a short time and then stops to let another couple talk. There is never more than one speaker talking in the room, no one has to worry about two conversations mixing. The drawback is that it limits the practical number of discussions in the room (bandwidth wise).

:CDMA: any speaker can talk at any time; however each uses a different language. Each listener can only understand the language of their partner.  As more and more couples talk, the background noise (representing the ''noise floor'') gets louder, but because of the difference in languages, conversations do not mix. The drawback is that at some point, one cannot talk any louder. After this if the noise still rises (more people join the party/cell) the listener cannot make out what the talker is talking about without coming closer to the talker. In effect, CDMA cell coverage decreases as the number of active users increases. This is called cell breathing.

== Strengths and Weaknesses of IS-95 and GSM<ref>{{cite web | url = http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/7107 | title = IS-95 (CDMA) and GSM(TDMA) | accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> ==

=== Advantages of GSM ===

* Less signal deterioration inside buildings.
* Ability to use [[Cell phone repeater|repeater]]s.
* [[Talktime]] is generally higher in GSM phones due to the pulse nature of transmission.
* The availability of [[Subscriber Identity Module]]s allows users to switch networks and handsets at will, aside from a [[SIM lock|subsidy lock]].
* GSM [[List of mobile network operators|covers virtually all parts of the world]] so international [[roaming]] is not a problem.
* The much bigger number of [[List of mobile network operators|subscribers globally]] creates a better [[network effect]] for GSM handset makers, carriers and end users.

=== Disadvantages of GSM ===

* Interferes with some electronics, especially certain audio amplifiers.
* Intellectual property is concentrated among a few industry participants, creating barriers to entry for new entrants and limiting competition among phone manufacturers. Situation is however worse in CDMA-based systems like IS-95, where Qualcomm is the major IP holder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
* GSM has a fixed maximum cell site range of 120&nbsp;km,<ref>http://www.allbusiness.com/electronics/computer-electronics-manufacturing/6838169-1.html</ref> which is imposed by [[Timing advance|technical limitations]].<ref>http://www.arcx.com/sites/faq.htm</ref>  This is expanded from the old limit of 35&nbsp;km.

=== Advantages of IS-95 ===

* Capacity is IS-95's biggest asset; it can accommodate more users per [[MHz]] of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than any other technology.
* Has no built-in limit to the number of concurrent users.
* Uses precise clocks that do not limit the distance a tower can cover.<ref>[http://www.arcx.com/sites/faq.htm Frequently Asked PCS Questions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* Consumes less power and covers large areas so cell size in IS-95 is larger.
* Able to produce a reasonable call with lower signal (cell phone reception) levels.
* Uses [[Soft handover|soft handoff]], reducing the likelihood of dropped calls.
* IS-95's variable rate voice coders reduce the rate being transmitted when speaker is not talking, which allows the channel to be packed more efficiently.
* Has a well-defined path to higher data rates.

=== Disadvantages of IS-95 ===

* Most technologies are patented and must be licensed from [[Qualcomm]].
* ''Breathing'' of base stations, where coverage area shrinks under load. As the number of subscribers using a particular site goes up, the range of that site goes down.
* Because IS-95 towers interfere with each other, they are normally installed on much shorter towers.  Because of this, IS-95 may not perform well in hilly terrain.
* USSD, PTT, concatenated/E-sms are not supported by IS-95/CDMA
* IS-95 covers a smaller portion of the world, and IS-95 phones are generally unable to roam internationally.
* Manufacturers are often hesitant to release IS-95 devices due to the smaller market, so features are sometimes late in coming to IS-95 devices.
* Even barring [[SIM lock|subsidy locks]], CDMA phones are linked by [[Electronic Serial Number|ESN]] to a specific network, thus phones are typically not portable across providers.

== Development of the Market Share of Mobile Standards ==

This graphic compares the market shares of the different mobile standards.

In a fast-growing market, GSM/3GSM (red) grows faster than the market and is gaining market share, the CDMA family (blue) grows at about the same rate as the market, while other technologies (grey) are being phased out
