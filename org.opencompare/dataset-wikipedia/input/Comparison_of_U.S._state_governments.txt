The [[states of the United States]] have governments with many similarities. All states are required by the [[U.S. Constitution|constitution]] to have [[Article_Four_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_1:_Republican_government|republican governments]]. Despite their similarities, all states have different government structures and procedures.

The following tables compare some of the features of [[State governments of the United States|state governments]], territory governments, and the District of Columbia, in the [[United States]].

==Legislative==
{{See also|List of United States state legislatures|l1=Political composition of state legislatures|United States state legislatures' partisan trend|l2=Historical trend of state legislature political composition}}

With the exception of [[Nebraska]], all American state legislatures are [[bicameral]], meaning there is one legislative body separated into two units. Nebraska eliminated its lower house with a referendum during the 1936 elections. Also, some systems, such as [[New York]]'s, have two legislative bodies while never technically referring to them in the state constitution as a single body. These dual systems are generally considered bicameral.

The following table compares common legislative features of each state, the District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories.

=== Supermajority requirements ===
While only 13 states have a [[filibuster]], there are often restrictions on the majority a state needs to raise taxes.

|Alabama
|The Alabama State Senate allows a filibuster, and has a general three-fifths requirement to enact [[cloture]]. A simple majority of 18 is acceptable when dealing with the budget and redistricting.<ref>http://www.legislature.state.al.us/senate/senaterules/senaterules1.html</ref>
|-

|Arkansas
|Arkansas, along with Rhode Island, is one of the only states that requires a supermajority to pass a budget. A three-fourths majority is required for appropriations, except for education, highways, and paying down the state debt, which require a simple majority.<ref>http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget/supermajority-vote-requirements-to-pass-the-budget.aspx</ref>

|bgcolor="#cc6633"|
|[[California]]
|From 1933-2011 there was a two-thirds requirement for general fund appropriations for purposes other than public schools (Const., Art. IV, Sec. 12). Because the Legislature typically passes one main budget bill, the requirement effectively applied to the whole budget bill.<ref>http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/budget/supermajority-vote-requirements-to-pass-the-budget.aspx</ref> There has been a two-thirds requirement for tax increases since [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]]. In [[California elections, 2010#Proposition_25|2010, voters approved Proposition 25]], eliminating the 2/3 requirement for the budget, but keeping it for tax increases.

==Executive==
{{See also|Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|l1=Gubernatorial term limits}}
The [[Governor]] is the chief executive official in all states. D.C. has a mayor which serves executive functions in the District, although constitutionally it is controlled by Congress.

<!-- The table does not distinguish (right now) whether or not the term limits are for total terms, or consecutive terms. This, in addition to other quirks in term limit laws, should be noted succinctly in the appropriate field. -->
