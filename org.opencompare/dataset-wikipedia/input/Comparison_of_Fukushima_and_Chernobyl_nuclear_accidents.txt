|-
| '''Cause of the accident''' || The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large [[tsunami]]. A major [[2011 Tohoku earthquake|earthquake and tsunami]] caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic [[decay heat]] casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]s and explosive loss of [[reactor containment]]. || Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive [[void coefficient]] and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became [[prompt critical]]. This was followed by a [[steam explosion]] that exposed the fuel, a raging [[graphite]] fire, and a [[core meltdown]].
