These tables provide a '''comparison of operating systems''', listing general and technical information for a number of widely used and currently available [[personal computer|PC]] and for some handheld (including [[smartphone]] and [[tablet computer]]) [[operating system]]s. The article, [[usage share of operating systems]] provides a broader, and more general, comparison of operating systems that includes [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] and [[supercomputers]].

Because of the large number and variety of available [[Linux distribution]]s, they are all grouped under a single entry; see [[comparison of Linux distributions]] for a detailed comparison. There are also a variety of BSD operating systems and DOS operating systems, covered in [[comparison of BSD operating systems]] and [[comparison of DOS operating systems]]. For information on views of each operating system, see [[operating system advocacy]].
<!-- NOTES TO EDITORS, PLEASE READ THIS
 - All tables in this article are meant to be sorted alphabetically
 - All tables should list the same operating systems. If you add an OS, please add it to ALL tables.
 - The unfixed bug count in the security table WAS updated automatically by User:SecuniBot. There WAS no
   need to update that column manually, except to add the link to the secunia.com page corresponding to
   an OS the first time. See below. The security table currently needs to be updated manually until this bot can be repaired/updated.
 - Please have a look at the conventions used in existing table entries when adding new data. E.g.
   the "Target system type" column should list systems types like "Server", "Workstation", "Personal computer",
   "Network Appliance", "Embedded system".
 - It's not necessary to list all architectures in the "supported architectures" columns. Just list the primary
   ones (maybe up to five) and add "some others" or "N others" or something like that if there are more.
   Specifically, its not necessary to add an arch to this list just because an experimental port exists.
   Listed archs should be fully supported.
 - The same goes for filesystems, just list the important ones.
 - Use "?" or the {inc} template for missing data, not "-". "-" is used to mean "none" / "n/a" in these tables.
 - Some systems that have been removed from this comparison by consensus on the talk page. Please refer
   to the discussion there before re-adding them: AmigaOS, BeOS, Reactos
 - Footnotes shall be grouped references for their respective tables. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing sources#List-defined references -->
<!-- SECUNIBOT IS NOT PERMITTED
This comment forbids the bot [[User:SecuniBot]] permission to update the ''unpatched vulnerabilities''
column of the Security table, until after the bot is updated to conform to the current Secunia URI scheme
and the current Security table format scheme. If the bot were to update an entry, it would have the format
| [http://secunia.com/product/<number>/ <number>] || <date>
Where <number> is any sequence of digits, and <date> is either '-' or a date in numeric format, i.e.
  [[<number>-<number>-<number>]]

while it should have the format
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/<PRODUCT_NUMBER>/ <NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Extremely critical>]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/<PRODUCT_NUMBER>/ <NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Highly critical>]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/<PRODUCT_NUMBER>/ <NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Moderately critical>]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/<PRODUCT_NUMBER>/ <NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Less critical>]
| [http://secunia.com/advisories/product/<PRODUCT_NUMBER>/ <NUMBER_OF_UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITIES_LISTED_AS_Not critical>]{IF non-zero, then follow with oldest UNPATCHED_VULNERABILITY of this criticality}<br>[http://secunia.com/advisories/<VULNERABILITY_NUMBER>/ {{start date and age|<YYYY>|<MM>|<DD>|br=yes}}]
| [http://www.securityfocus.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?c=12&op=display_list&vendor=<VENDOR_NAME>&title=<PRODUCT_TITLE>&version=<VERSION_NUMBER_AS_LISTED_IN_GENERAL_INFORMATION_LATEST_STABLE_VERSION_COLUMN> <NUMBER_OF_VULNERABILITIES>]<br>[http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/<VULNERABILITY_NUMBER> {{start date and age|<YYYY>|<MM>|<DD>|br=yes}}]

All other entries will be ignored. The current bot fetches the linked secunia.com page and counts the advisories
marked ''less critical'' or above. The footnote below the table that gives the ''last updated'' date is
also adjusted. The bot is run by [[User:Sperling]]. The source is available at [[User:SecuniBot/source]].
This bot has not been updated since 2006-08-27T07:40:31, nor has it's maintainer contributed since 2008-08-19T03:55:38. -->

{{Reflist|group="t"|refs=
<ref name="GUI">Operating systems where the GUI is not installed and turned on by default are often bundled with an implementation of the [[X Window System]], installation of which is usually optional.</ref>
<ref name="API">Most operating systems use proprietary APIs in addition to any supported standards.</ref>
<ref name="BSDX">NetBSD and OpenBSD include the [[X Window System]] as base install sets, managed in their respective main source repository, including local modifications. Packages are also provided for more up-to-date versions which may be less tested.</ref>
<ref name="WindowsFS">Windows can read and write with Ext2 and Ext3 file systems only when a driver from [http://www.fs-driver.org FS-driver] or [[Ext2Fsd]] is installed. However, using [[Explore2fs]], Windows can read from, but not write to, Ext2 and Ext3 file systems. Windows can also access ReiserFS through [http://p-nand-q.com/download/rfstool.html rfstool] and related programs.</ref>
<ref name="i686">only i686 CPU</ref>
<ref name="AmigaOSinstaller">Amiga OS features since OS 2.0 version a standard centralized Install utility called [[AmigaOS#Workbench 2.0 user interface improvements|Installer]], which could be used by any software house to install programs. It works as a [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] language interpreter, and install procedures could be listed as simple text. AmigaOS can also benefit of a 3rd party copyrighted library called [[XAD (software)|XAD]] that is available for all POSIX ([[Unix]], [[Linux]], BSD, and for [[AmigaOS]], [[MorphOS]], etc.). This library is freely distributable and publicly available on [[Aminet]] Amiga centralized repository of all Open Source or Free programs and utilities. XAD.Library, complete with GUI Voodoo-X, is based on modules and capable to manage over 300 compression methods and package systems (Voodoo-X GUI supports 80 package systems), including those widely accepted as standards such as [[ZIP (file format)|.ZIP]], [[Cabinet (file format)|.CAB]], [[LHA (file format)|.LHA]], [[LZX (algorithm)|.LZX]], [[RPM Package Manager|.RPM]], etc.</ref>
<ref name="AmigaOSinstallation">A standard AmigaOS installation requires usually only few files (typically 3 to 10 files) to be copied in their appropriate directory, and libraries and language files for national localization to be put in their standard OS directories. Any Amiga user with some minimal experience knows where these files should be copied and could perform programs installations by hand.</ref>
<ref name="AmiUpdate">AmiUpdate is capable to update AmigaOS files and also all Amiga programs which are registered to use the same update program that is standard for Amiga. Updating AmigaOS requires only few libraries to be put in standard OS location (for example all libraries are stored in "Libs:" standard virtual device and absolute path finder for "Libs" directory, Fonts are all in "Fonts:" absolute locator, the files for language localization are all stored in "Locale:" and so on). This leaves Amiga users with a minimal knowledge of the system almost free to perform by hand the update of the system files.</ref>

'''NOTE:''' Linux systems may vary by distribution which specific program, or even 'command' is called, via the POSIX <tt>alias</tt> function.  For example, if you wanted to use the DOS <tt>dir</tt> to give you a directory listing with one detailed file listing per line you could use <tt>alias dir='ls -lahF'</tt> (e.g. in a session configuration file).

{{Reflist|group="c"|refs=
<ref name="nice1">This feature is still in development, see [http://unix.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/FreeBSD/stable/2009-01/msg00316.html].</ref>
<ref name="nice2">The nice command utilizes the setpriority() system call, which affects I/O priority, see [http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man2/setpriority.2.html OS X man page] .</ref>
