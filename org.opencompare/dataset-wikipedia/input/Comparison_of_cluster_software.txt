'''Table Explanation'''

* ''Software'': The name of the application that is described
* ''SMP aware'':
** basic: hard split into multiple virtual host
** basic+: hard split into multiple virtual host with some minimal/incomplete communication between virtual host on the same computer
** dynamic: split the resource of the computer(CPU/Ram) on demand
