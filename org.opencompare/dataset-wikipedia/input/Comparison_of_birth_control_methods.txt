[[File:Effectivenessofcontraceptives.png|thumb|450px|Effectiveness of contraceptive methods with respect to birth control. Only condoms are useful to prevent [[sexually transmitted infections]]]]
'''Comparison of birth control methods''': Different types of [[birth control]] methods have large differences in effectiveness, actions required of users, and side effects.  Different methods require different actions of users.  Barrier methods, [[spermicide]]s, or [[coitus interruptus]] must be used at every act of intercourse.  The male condom may not be applied until the penis is erect.  Barriers such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]], caps, the [[contraceptive sponge]], and [[female condom]]s may be placed several hours before intercourse begins (note that when using the female condom the penis must be guided into place when initiating intercourse).  The female condom should be removed immediately after intercourse, and before arising.<ref name=CT19thEdCh19>{{cite book |last1=Cates |first1=Willard |last2=Raymond |first2=Elizabeth |chapter=Vaginal Barriers and Spermicides |year=2008 |editor1-last=Hatcher |editor1-first=Robert A. |editor2-first=James |editor2-last=Trussell |editor3-first=Anita L. |editor3-last=Nelson |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th |location=New York |publisher=Ardent Media |isbn=978-1-59708-001-9}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref> The other female barrier methods must be left in place for several hours after sex.  Spermicides, depending on the form, may be applied several minutes to an hour before intercourse begins.

With IUDs, female or male sterilization, and hormone implant there is "little or nothing to do" post initial procedure; there is nothing to put in place before intercourse to prevent pregnancy<ref name="plannedparenthood.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/iud-4245.htm |title=Planned Parenthood IUD Birth Control - Mirena IUD - ParaGard IUD |work= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref> Intrauterine methods require clinic visits for installation and removal or replacement (if desired) only once every several years (5-12), depending on the device. Sterilization is a one-time, permanent procedure - after the success of surgery is verified (for vasectomy), no action is usually required of users.

Implants, such as [[Nexplanon]], provide effective birth control for three years without any user action between insertion and removal of the implant.  Insertion and removal of the Implant involves a minor surgical procedure. Oral contraceptives require some action every day. Other hormonal methods require less frequent action - weekly for the patch, twice a month for vaginal ring, monthly for combined injectable contraceptive, and every twelve weeks for the injection [[Depo-Provera]]. Fertility awareness-based methods require some action every day to monitor and record fertility signs. The [[lactational amenorrhea method]] (LAM) requires breast feeding at least every four to six hours.

==User dependence==
Different methods require different levels of diligence by users.  Methods with little or nothing to do or remember, or that require a clinic visit less than once per year are said to be ''non-user dependent'', ''forgettable'' or ''top-tier'' methods.<ref name="Hatcher20th">{{cite book |editor1-last=Hatcher |editor1-first=Robert A. |editor2-first=James |editor2-last=Trussell |editor3-first=Anita L. |editor3-last=Nelson |title=Contraceptive Technology |publisher=Ardent Media |location=New York |year=2011 |edition=20th |isbn=978-1-59708-004-0}}{{page needed|date=June 2012}}</ref>  Intrauterine methods, implants and sterilization fall into this category.<ref name="Hatcher20th" />  For methods that are not user dependent, the actual and perfect-use failure rates are very similar.

Many hormonal methods of birth control, and LAM require a moderate level of thoughtfulness. For many hormonal methods, clinic visits must be made every three months to a year to renew the prescription.  The pill must be taken every day, the patch must be reapplied weekly, or the ring must be replaced monthly.  Injections are required every 12 weeks.  The rules for LAM must be followed every day.  Both LAM and hormonal methods provide a reduced level of protection against pregnancy if they are occasionally used incorrectly (rarely going longer than 4–6 hours between breastfeeds, a late pill or injection, or forgetting to replace a patch or ring on time).  The actual failure rates for LAM and hormonal methods are somewhat higher than the perfect-use failure rates.

Higher levels of user commitment are required for other methods.<ref name=WHOTable>{{cite report|title = Helping women understand contraceptive effectiveness | author = Kathleen Henry Shears,

==Side effects==
Different forms of birth control have different potential side effects.  Not all, or even most, users will experience side effects from a method.

The less effective the method, the greater the risk of the side-effects associated with pregnancy.

Minimal or no other side effects are possible with coitus interruptus, fertility awareness-based, and LAM. Some forms of periodic abstinence encourage examination of the cervix; insertion of the fingers into the vagina to perform this examination may cause changes in the vaginal environment. Following the rules for LAM may delay a woman's first post-partum menstruation beyond what would be expected from different breastfeeding practices.

Barrier methods have a risk of allergic reaction.  Users sensitive to latex may use barriers made of less allergenic materials - polyurethane condoms, or silicone diaphragms, for example.  Barrier methods are also often combined with spermicides, which have possible side effects of genital irritation, vaginal infection, and urinary tract infection.

Sterilization procedures are generally considered to have low risk of side effects, though some persons and organizations disagree.<!--

After IUD insertion, users may experience irregular periods in the first 3–6 months with Mirena, and sometimes heavier periods and worse menstrual cramps with ParaGard.  However, "ninety-nine percent of IUD users are pleased with them".  A positive characteristic of IUDs is that fertility and the ability to become pregnant returns quickly once the IUD is removed.<ref name="plannedparenthood.org"/>  
 
Because of their systemic nature, hormonal methods have the largest number of possible side effects.<!--

===Sexually transmitted disease prevention===

{{main|safe sex}}

[[condom|Male]] and [[female condom]]s provide significant protection against [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STD) when used consistently and correctly.  They also provide some protection against [[cervical cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053284 |title=Condom Use and the Risk of Genital Human Papillomavirus Infection in Young Women |year=2006 |last1=Winer |first1=Rachel L. |last2=Hughes |first2=James P. |last3=Feng |first3=Qinghua |last4=O'Reilly |first4=Sandra |last5=Kiviat |first5=Nancy B. |last6=Holmes |first6=King K. |last7=Koutsky |first7=Laura A. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=25 |pages=2645–54 |pmid=16790697}}</ref><ref name="Hogewoning2003">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ijc.11474 |title=Condom use promotes regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and clearance of human papillomavirus: A randomized clinical trial |year=2003 |last1=Hogewoning |first1=Cornelis J.A. |last2=Bleeker |first2=Maaike C.G. |last3=Van Den Brule |first3=Adriaan J.C. |last4=Voorhorst |first4=Feja J. |last5=Snijders |first5=Peter J.F. |last6=Berkhof |first6=Johannes |last7=Westenend |first7=Pieter J. |last8=Meijer |first8=Chris J.L.M. |journal=International Journal of Cancer |volume=107 |issue=5 |pmid=14566832 |pages=811–6}}</ref> Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.<ref name=DualProtection>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00007435-200203000-00007 |title=Dual Protection Against Unintended Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Infections |year=2002 |last1=Cates |first1=Willard |last2=Steiner |first2=Markus J. |journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=168–74 |pmid=11875378}}</ref>

Other barrier methods, such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] may provide limited protection against infections in the upper genital tract.  Other methods provide little or no protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

==Effectiveness calculation==
Failure rates may be calculated by either the [[Pearl Index]] or a [[decrement table|life table method]].  A "perfect-use" rate is where any rules of the method are rigorously followed, and (if applicable) the method is used at every act of intercourse.

Actual failure rates are higher than perfect-use rates for a variety of reasons:
* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the method's users
* conscious user non-compliance with method.
* insurance providers sometimes impede access to medications (e.g. require prescription refills on a monthly basis)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2007.09.001 |title=Reducing unintended pregnancy in the United States |year=2008 |last1=Trussell |first1=James |last2=Wynn |first2=L.L. |journal=Contraception |volume=77 |pages=1–5 |pmid=18082659 |issue=1}}</ref>

For instance, someone using oral forms of hormonal birth control might be given incorrect information by a health care provider as to the frequency of intake, or for some reason not take the pill one or several days, or not go to the pharmacy on time to renew the prescription, or the pharmacy might be unwilling to provide enough pills to cover an extended absence.

==Effectiveness==
The table below color codes the '''typical-use''' and '''perfect-use''' failure rates, where the failure rate is measured as the expected number of pregnancies per year per 100 women using the method:
:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#e0ffff"
| style="text-align:right;"| Blue || style="text-align:right;"| under &nbsp;&nbsp;1% || lower risk
|- style="background:#e0ffe0"
| style="text-align:right;"| Green || style="text-align:right;"| up to &nbsp;&nbsp;5% ||  
|- style="background:#ffffc0"
| style="text-align:right;"| Yellow || style="text-align:right;"| up to 10% ||   
|- style="background:#fda;"
| style="text-align:right;"| Orange || style="text-align:right;"| up to 20% || 
|- style="background:#fcc;"
| style="text-align:right;"| Red || style="text-align:right;"| over 20% || higher risk
|- style="background:#dcdcdc"
| style="text-align:right;"| Grey || style="text-align:right;"| no data || no data available
|}

In the '''user action required''' column, items that are ''non-user dependent'' (require action once per year or less) also have a blue background.

Some methods may be used simultaneously for higher effectiveness rates. For example, using condoms with spermicides the estimated perfect use failure rate would be comparable to the perfect use failure rate of the implant.<ref name="Hatcher20th" />  However, mathematically combining the rates to estimate the effectiveness of combined methods can be inaccurate, as the effectiveness of each method is not necessarily independent, except in the perfect case.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Philip |last1=Kestelman |first2=James |last2=Trussell |year=1991 |title=Efficacy of the Simultaneous Use of Condoms and Spermicides |journal=Family Planning Perspectives |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=226–7, 232 |jstor=2135759 |doi=10.2307/2135759 |pmid=1743276}}</ref>

If a method is known or suspected to have been ineffective, such as a condom breaking, [[emergency contraception]] (ECP) may be taken up to 72 to 120 hours after [[sexual intercourse]]. Emergency contraception should be taken shortly before or as soon after intercourse as possible, as its efficacy decreases with increasing delay.  Although ECP is considered an emergency measure, levonorgestrel ECP taken shortly before sex may be used as a primary method for woman who have sex only a few times a year and want a hormonal method, but don’t want to take hormones all the time.<ref name=shelton>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0010-7824(02)00313-X |title=Repeat emergency contraception: Facing our fears |year=2002 |last1=Shelton |first1=James D |journal=Contraception |volume=66 |pages=15–7 |pmid=12169375 |issue=1}}</ref>  Failure rate of repeated or regular use of LNG ECP is similar to rate for those using a barrier method.<ref name="WHO ECP Effectiveness">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0010-7824(00)00116-5 |title=Efficacy and side effects of immediate postcoital levonorgestrel used repeatedly for contraception |year=2000 |journal=Contraception |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=303–8 |pmid=10906500}}</ref><ref name=pmid17314078>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/humrep/dem003 |title=The effectiveness of a fertility awareness based method to avoid pregnancy in relation to a couple's sexual behaviour during the fertile time: A prospective longitudinal study |year=2007 |last1=Frank-Herrmann |first1=P. |last2=Heil |first2=J. |last3=Gnoth |first3=C. |last4=Toledo |first4=E. |last5=Baur |first5=S. |last6=Pyper |first6=C. |last7=Jenetzky |first7=E. |last8=Strowitzki |first8=T. |last9=Freundl |first9=G.| displayauthors = 8 |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=1310–9 |pmid=17314078}}</ref>

The unadjusted pregnancy rate in the six-month study was 8.7% among spermicide users and 12.9% among non-spermicide users.  No pregnancies occurred among nulliparous users of the Lea's Shield.  Assuming the effectiveness ratio of nulliparous to parous users is the same for the Lea's Shield as for the Prentif cervical cap and the Today contraceptive sponge, the unadjusted six-month pregnancy rate would be 2.2% for spermicide users and 2.9% for those who used the device without spermicide.</ref><ref name=parous group=note/>

==Cost and cost-effectiveness==

Family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions.<ref name=Tsui>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |title=Family Planning and the Burden of Unintended Pregnancies |year=2010 |last1=Tsui |first1=A.

E. |journal=Epidemiologic Reviews |volume=32 |pages=152–74 |pmid=20570955 |issue=1 |pmc=3115338}}</ref>  Costs of contraceptives include method costs (including supplies, office visits, training), cost of method failure ([[ectopic pregnancy]], [[Miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]], induced abortion, birth, child care expenses) and cost of side effects.<ref name=Trussell2009>{{cite journal |pmid=19041435 |year=2009 |last1=Trussell |first1=J |last2=Lalla |first2=AM |last3=Doan |first3=QV |last4=Reyes |first4=E |last5=Pinto |first5=L |last6=Gricar |first6=J |title=Cost effectiveness of contraceptives in the United States |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2008.08.003 |journal=Contraception |pmc=3638200}}</ref>  Contraception saves money by reducing [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]] and reducing transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s. By comparison, in the US, method related costs vary from nothing to about $1,000 for a year or more of reversible contraception.

During the initial five years, vasectomy is comparable in cost to the IUD. Vasectomy is much less expensive and safer than tubal ligation.

Since ecological breastfeeding and fertility awareness are behavioral they cost nothing or a small amount upfront for a thermometer and / or training. Fertility awareness based methods can be used throughout a woman's reproductive lifetime.

Not using contraceptives is the most expensive option. While in that case there are no method related costs, it has the highest failure rate, and thus the highest failure related costs. Even if one only considers medical costs relating to preconception care and birth, any method of contraception saves money compared to using no method.

The most effective and the most cost-effective methods are long-acting methods. Unfortunately these methods often have significant up-front costs, requiring the user to pay a portion of these costs prevents some from using more effective methods.<ref name=Cleland>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1104373 |title=Family Planning as a Cost-Saving Preventive Health Service |year=2011 |last1=Cleland |first1=Kelly |last2=Peipert |first2=Jeffrey F. |last3=Westhoff |first3=Carolyn |last4=Spear |first4=Scott |last5=Trussell |first5=James |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=364 |issue=18 |pages=e37 |pmid=21506736}}</ref> Contraception saves money for the public health system and insurers.
