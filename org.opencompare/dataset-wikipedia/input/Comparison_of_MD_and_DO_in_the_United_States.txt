{{Osteopathic Medicine}}
In the United States, there are two types of physicians that practice medicine. Most physicians hold the [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree (M.D.), while [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic]] physicians hold the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree (D.O.).<ref name="osteopathic">{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/what-is-a-do/Pages/default.aspx |title=What is a DO? |publisher=Osteopathic.org |accessdate=20 Dec 2014}}</ref> Other than teaching [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]], the medical training for an M.D. and D.O. is virtually indistinguishable.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dennis L.

==Background==
{{See also|Osteopathic medicine in the United States}}
In 2005, Jordan Cohen, the president of the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) stated:

<blockquote>After more than a century of often bitterly contentious relationships between the osteopathic and allopathic medical professions, we now find ourselves living at a time when osteopathic and allopathic graduates are both sought after by many of the same residency programs; are in most instances both licensed by the same licensing boards; are both privileged by many of the same hospitals; and are found in appreciable numbers on the faculties of each other's medical schools.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jordan|title=Following in Flexner's Footsteps|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/MemberCenter/Premeds/edRx/Footsteps2.aspx|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

The AMA's current definition of a physician is "an individual who has received a 'Doctor of Medicine' or a 'Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine' degree or an equivalent degree following successful completion of a prescribed course of study from a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine."<ref>{{cite web|title=Resolution 302 referred|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/council-on-med-ed/res302a08.pdf|publisher=AMA House of Delegates|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref>

A 2012 survey of students applying to both U.S. M.D. and D.O. schools found that 46% were admitted only to a D.O. school, 9% were admitted only to an M.D. school, 26% were admitted to both, and 19% were not admitted to any medical schools.<ref name=2012_Applicants_to_MD&DO>{{cite web|title=2012 Applicants to U.S. and Offshore Medical Schools|url=http://www.aacom.org/data/applicantsmatriculants/Documents/2012%20Applicants%20to%20U%20S%20%20and%20Offshore%20Medical%20Schools.pdf|publisher=AACOM|accessdate=2 Nov 2014}}</ref> Geographic location was the top reason given by both D.O. and M.D. students for choosing the school in which they enrolled.<ref name=2012_Applicants_to_MD&DO /> The college's approach to learning and teaching and the college's reputation were highly ranked by respondents attending D.O. medical schools.<ref name=2012_Applicants_to_MD&DO />

Of physicians practicing in the United States, 7% are osteopathic physicians (2010),<ref name=OMP2010>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical Profession Report 2010|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/who-we-are/Documents/Osteopathic-Medical-Profession-Report-2010.pdf|publisher=American Osteopathic Association}}</ref> 26% are international medical graduates (2012),<ref>{{cite web|title=International Medical Graduates in American Medicine: Contemporary challenges and opportunities|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/img/img-workforce-paper.pdf|publisher=American Medical Association|page=7|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref> and 67% are allopathic physicians. Between 1980 and 2005, the annual number of new MDs remained stable at around 16,000. During the same period, the number of new DOs increased by more than 200% (from about 1,150 to about 2,800).<ref name="per capita">Salsberg, Edward and Grover, Atul.

The distribution of both M.D. and D.O. physicians in the United States is not uniform, as the number of physicians per capita varies.

==Cultural differences==
Some authors describe less quantifiable distinctions between the two medical professions. Avery Hurt writes, "In actual practice, the variations between the two types of physicians are often so slight as to be unnoticeable to patients, and a day in the life of each can appear indistinguishable. But the differences are there, subtle but deep."<ref name=Hurt>{{cite web |url= http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Homepage/Publications/TheNewPhysician/2007/tnp342.aspx |title=Inside osteopathic medicine's parallel world |author= Hurt, Avery |date=February 2007 |work=The New Physician |publisher=American Medical Student Association |accessdate=13 July 2012 }}</ref> Several studies have investigated these differences.  One study compared the patient interactions of DOs and MDs.  The study found that "osteopathic physicians were more likely to use patient's first names and to discuss the social, family and emotional impact of illnesses." For example, "66% of DOs discussed a patient's emotional state compared with about one-third of MDs."  The same study found that MD qualified "physicians scored higher in discussing literature or scientific basis of treatment."<ref>Adams, Damon {{cite journal |author=Adams D |title=Small study compares styles: Osteopathic physicians talk more about feelings |journal=Amednews.com |date=Aug 23, 2003 |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2003/08/25/prsb0825.htm}}</ref>  Another study analyzed 341.4 million patient visits to general and [[family medicine]] specialists in the United States, including 64.9 million visits to DOs and 276.5 million visits to MDs.  It found that there was no significant difference between DOs and MDs "with regard to time spent with patients and preventive medicine services."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Licciardone JC |title=A comparison of patient visits to osteopathic and allopathic general and family medicine physicians: results from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2003–2004 |journal=Osteopath Med Prim Care |volume=1 |page=2 |year=2007 |pmid=17371578 |pmc=1805772 |doi=10.1186/1750-4732-1-2 }}</ref>

===Self-characterization===
A Harvard study found significant differences in the attitudes of DOs and MDs.  The study found that 40.1% of MD students and physicians described themselves as "socioemotionally" oriented over "technoscientific" orientation. 63.8% of their DO counterparts self-identified as socioemotional. (p < .0001)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Peters AS, Clark-Chiarelli N, Block SD |title=Comparison of osteopathic and allopathic medical Schools' support for primary care |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=730–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10632817 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.03179.x |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.03179.x |pmc=1496864}}</ref>

===Perceptions===
One study of DOs attempted to investigate their perceptions of differences in philosophy and practice between themselves and their MD counterparts.  88% of the respondents had a [[self-identification]] as osteopathic physicians, but less than half felt their patients identified them as such.  The study asked respondents to identify points of philosophical and practical difference between DOs and MDs; no more than 1/3 of respondents could agree on any single such point of difference.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Johnson SM, Kurtz ME |title=Perceptions of philosophic and practice differences between US osteopathic physicians and their allopathic counterparts |journal=Soc Sci Med |volume=55 |issue=12 |pages=2141–8 |date=December 2002|pmid=12409127 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953601003574 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00357-4}}</ref>

===Self-Identification===
As the training of DOs and MDs becomes less distinct, some have expressed concern that their unique characteristics will be lost.<ref name=Ziegler/>  Others welcome the rapprochement and already consider modern medicine to be the type of medicine practiced by both "MD and DO type doctors."<ref>[http://www.neurosurgical.com/neurgosurgery_glossary/a.htm Allopathic] Medical/Neurosurgical Glossary. Northern California Neurosurgery. accessed Nov 5, 2007.</ref>  One persistent difference is the respective acceptance of the terms "allopathic" and "osteopathic."  DO medical organizations and medical schools all include the word ''osteopathic'' in their names, and such groups actively promote an "osteopathic approach" to medicine. While "osteopathy" was a term used by its founder [[Andrew Taylor Still|AT Still]] to describe his new philosophy of medicine, "[[allopathic medicine]]" was originally a derogatory term coined by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] to contrast the conventional medicine of his day with his alternative system of [[homeopathic medicine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berkenwald|first=Alan D.|title=In the Name of Medicine|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=1 February 1998|volume=128|issue=3|pages=246–250|url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?volume=128&issue=3&page=246#r7-23|accessdate=12 July 2012|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-128-3-199802010-00023}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title = Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America|author=Whorton JC|publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]]|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517162-4|pages = 18, 52|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&pg=PA18|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref> Today, the term "allopathic physician" is used infrequently, usually in discussions relating to osteopathic medicine or alternative medicine.

The [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME) accredits the 141 U.S.-medical schools<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Schools|url=https://www.aamc.org/about/medicalschools/|publisher=American Association of Medical Colleges|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcme.org/directry.htm |title=Directory of Accredited Programs |publisher=LCME |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref> that award the M.D. degree, while the [[American Osteopathic Association|American Osteopathic Association (AOA)]] [[Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation]] (COCA) accredits the 30 colleges of osteopathic medicine in 42 locations in the United States that award the D.O. degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/affiliates/Pages/osteopathic-medical-schools.aspx |title=Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine |publisher=Osteopathic.org |accessdate=2012-02-22}}</ref>

[[Michigan State University]] and [[Rowan University]] are the only universities that have both M.D. and D.O. accredited programs.<ref name="tcomMD">{{cite news|last=Hedger|first=Brian|title=Texas university explores offering an MD degree in addition to its DO program|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2009/04/27/prsc0427.htm|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=American Medical News|date=April 27, 2009}}</ref> In 2009, [[Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences|Kansas City University]] proposed starting a dual MD/DO program in addition to the existing DO program,<ref>{{cite news|title=Fired medical school president had been pushing big changes|url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/joplin_metro/x546223676/Fired-medical-school-president-had-been-pushing-big-changes|accessdate=30 June 2012|newspaper=Joplin Metro|date=December 25, 2009}}</ref> and the [[University of North Texas Health Science Center|University of North Texas]], explored the possibility of starting independent M.D. program that would be offered alongside the DO program.<ref name=tcomMD /> Both proposals were met with controversy. Proponents argued that adding an MD program would lead to more local residencies created, and improve the university’s ability to acquire research funding and state funding. Opponents argue that adding the MD programs could cause the osteopathic program to lose its focus on "holistic care," would result in more competition for the already limited number of existing residencies (if more were not opened), and would drain resources from the established osteopathic programs.

Overall, osteopathic medical schools have more modest research programs compared to M.D. schools, and fewer D.O. schools own a hospital.<ref name=SeparateEduPathway>{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Candace|author2=Mullan, Fitzhugh|title=The separate osteopathic medical education pathway: uniquely addressing national needs.

Osteopathic medical schools tend to have a stronger focus on primary care medicine than M.D. schools.<ref name=SeparateEduPathway /> D.O. schools have developed various strategies to encourage their graduates to pursue primary care, such as offering accelerated 3-year programs for primary care, focusing clinical education in [[community health centers]], and selecting rural or under-served urban areas for the location of new campuses.<ref name=SeparateEduPathway />

====Osteopathic manipulative medicine====
Many authors note the most obvious difference between the curricula of D.O. and M.D. schools is [[Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine|osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM)]], a form of hands-on care used to diagnose, treat and prevent illness or injury and is taught only at D.O. schools.

====Student aptitude indicators====
Some authors note the differences in average [[Grade point average|GPA]] and [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] scores of those who matriculate at D.O. schools versus those who matriculate at M.D. schools within the United States.  In 2012, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering U.S.-based M.D. programs were 31.2 and 3.68,<ref>{{cite web|title=Table 17: MCAT Scores and GPAs for Applicants and Matriculants to U.S. Medical Schools|url=https://www.aamc.org/download/161690/data/table17.pdf|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges|date=2000–2011}}</ref> respectively, and 26.85 and 3.51 for D.O. matriculants,<ref>{{cite web|title=AACOMAS Matriculant Profile 2012 Entering Class|url=http://www.aacom.org/data/applicantsmatriculants/Documents/2012-Applicant-Matriculant-Report.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|accessdate=14 July 2012}}</ref> although the gap has been getting smaller every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aacom.org/data/applicantsmatriculants/Documents/2011Matriculantsummary.pdf |title=Mean MCAT Scores & GPAs of Matriculating Osteopathic Students |format=PDF |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> Up to one third of students matriculating at a D.O. medical school were not accepted by M.D. programs;<ref name=Cooper>{{cite journal |author=Cooper RA |title=Medical schools and their applicants: an analysis |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=71–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12889752 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/22/4/71 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.22.4.71}}</ref> however, DO medical schools are more likely to accept non-traditional students,<ref>{{cite web|title=Osteopathic Medical College Information Book|url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-whole.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Madison Park |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/13/mid.life.doctors/index.html?hpt=hp_t2/ |title=Never too late to be a doctor |publisher=CNN News  |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 17, 2011}}</ref> who are older, coming to medicine as a second career, etc.  D.O. medical students are required to take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination ([[COMLEX-USA]]) that is sponsored by the [[National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners]] (NBOME).

Graduates of both D.O. and M.D. medical schools are eligible to apply to [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] programs through the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (NRMP), which represents ACGME-accredited programs. In 2003, 99% of new U.S. MDs and 43% of new U.S. DOs went on to train in ACGME-accredited residency programs.<ref name=Ziegler/>

Currently, the American Osteopathic Association accredits all D.O. residency programs.

In 2010-2011, approximately 41% of U.S. osteopathic medical students indicated that they intend to pursue an AOA or AOA/ACGME dually-accredited residency programs while 39% indicated that they intend to pursue an ACGME accredited residency program.<ref name="aacom">{{cite web|url=http://www.aacom.org/data/classsurveys/Documents/2010-11_Graduating_Seniors_Summary.pdf |title=AACOM 2010-11 Academic Year Survey of Graduating Seniors Summary Report |publisher=AACOM |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> In 2010-2011, approximately 12% of U.S. osteopathic medical students indicated that they intend to pursue an AOA/ACGME dually-accredited residency program, while 29% planned to pursue an AOA residency and 39% planned to pursue an ACGME-accredited residency program.<ref name="aacom"/>

(AOA-accredited) residencies.<ref name=summit>{{cite news|last=Schierhorn|first=Carolyn|title=Educators at summit frame future of OGME|url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/wp-content/uploads/pdf/pub_do0608training.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=[[The DO]]|date=June 2008}}</ref><ref name=summit2>{{cite news|last=Schierhorn|first=Carolyn|title=Slumping OGME piques educators at summit |url=http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/wp-content/uploads/pdf/pub_do0208training.pdf |pages=22–28 |accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=[[The DO]]|date=Feb 2008}}</ref>

====Resident specialty choice====

=====Primary care=====
There are notable differences in the specialty choices of DOs and MDs.  One study attributes this to a difference in the 'cultures' of their medical schools, concluding that the "practices and educational structures in osteopathic medical schools [D.O.] better support the production of [[primary care physician]]."<ref name="Peters AS, Clark-Chiarelli N, Block SD 1999 730–9">{{cite journal |author=Peters AS, Clark-Chiarelli N, Block SD |title=Comparison of osteopathic and allopathic medical Schools' support for primary care |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=730–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10632817 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0884-8734&date=1999&volume=14&issue=12&spage=730 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.1999.03179.x |pmc=1496864}}</ref> According to one survey, 54.6% of deans of M.D. medical schools reported that training future primary care physicians was more important to their institutions than training future specialist physicians, compared with 100% of D.O. medical school deans.

===Continuing medical education===
{{main|Continuing medical education}}
To maintain a license to practice medicine, U.S. physicians are required to complete additional training every few years, so called [[continuing medical education]] (CME).  There are subtle differences in the CME requirements for M.D. and D.O. qualified physicians, and in how these CME credits are approved.  The requirements for maintaining a physician license for M.D. or D.O. qualified physicians are almost identical in most states, though there are small differences. For example, in the case of Pennsylvania, M.D. licenses begin on December 31, whereas D.O. ones begin on October 31.<ref>[http://www.pamedsoc.org/MainMenuCategories/CME/Accreditation/Physicians/MDDO.html ''Requirements for license renewal'']. Pennsylvania Medical Society.</ref>

== Professional opportunities ==
There are currently more M.D. schools than D.O. schools offering medical training in the United States. However, the D.O. medical profession is expanding rapidly, with approximately 1 in 4 medical students now entering a D.O. medical school.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Hearing on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Program Integrity: Gainful Employment|url=http://www.aacom.org/advocacy/topics/testimony/Documents/Testimony%2011-04-2010.pdf|publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name="aamc2013survey" />  Both DOs and MDs have the option to train and practice in any of the medical specialties and sub-specialties. One exception is the Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine specialty which is only available to D.O.s who have completed a one-year traditional internship.<ref name="KCOM - NMS Residency program">{{cite web|url=http://www.nermc.com/About/Residency%20Program/Pages/Neuromusulaoskeletal-Medicine-OMM-Residency-Program-Osteopathic-Northeast-Regional.aspx|title=Neuromuscular Medicine and OMM|publisher=Northeast Regional Medical Center}}</ref>

Both degrees are recognized internationally as a medical degree. Accredited D.O. and M.D. medical schools are both included in the ''World Health Organization’s World Directory of Medical Schools''.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Directory of Medical Schools|url=http://avicenna.ku.dk/database/medicine|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> DOs are recognized and accepted by international medical organizations such as [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Work in the Field: FAQ|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-us/work-field/faq|publisher=Doctors Without Borders|accessdate=2 Nov 2014}}</ref>
