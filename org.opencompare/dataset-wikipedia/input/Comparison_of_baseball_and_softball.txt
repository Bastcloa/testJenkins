A '''comparison of [[baseball]] and [[softball]]''' can be made as softball is directly descended from baseball. An observer of one game would find the other very similar, but there are several important rule differences.

[[Fastpitch softball]] is more popular in competitive leagues, especially at the college and international tournament levels, while slow pitch is more popular in recreational [[sports league|league]]s where the relative skill levels of different players may vary widely. The different rules of slowpitch can be viewed as maintaining a competitive balance for less skilled players by eliminating certain strategies (e.g., base stealing and bunting) which require a high level of skill to counter. Additionally, recreational leagues may impose their own ground rules, either for competitive balance or to meet local constraints (e.g., a time limit may be imposed on a game to ensure multiple games can be played in one day).

| Underhand; must travel in an arc and within certain height restrictions (a common range is between {{Convert|6|and|12|ft|m}} above the ground). Umpire can call a pitch "illegal" while in flight.
|-
| Illegal pitch
| Most infractions punished as a ''[[balk]]'': the ball is dead, no change made to the count on the batter and all runners on base advance. With no runners on base, for some infractions, the pitch attempt is automatically a ball.
| The ball remains live. If the batter reaches base successfully and all runners advance, no penalty; otherwise, the play is negated, the pitch attempt is automatically a ball and runners advance one base.
| The ball remains live. If the batter does not swing, the pitch is automatically a ball.
