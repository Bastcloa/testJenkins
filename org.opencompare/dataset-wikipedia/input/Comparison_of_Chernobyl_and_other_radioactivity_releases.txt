This article compares the radioactivity release and decay from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] with various other events which involved a release of uncontrolled radioactivity.

==Chernobyl compared to background radiation==
[[File:Totalexternaldoseratecher.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[equivalent dose|external relative gamma dose]] for a person in the open near the Chernobyl disaster site. The intermediate lived [[fission product]]s like Cs-137 contribute nearly all of the gamma dose now after a number of decades have past, see opposite.]]

Natural sources of radiation are very prevalent in the environment, and come from cosmic rays, food sources (bananas have a particular high source), radon gas, granite and other dense rocks, and others.  The collective radiation background dose for natural sources in Europe is about 500,000 man Sieverts per year.   The total dose from Chernobyl is estimated at 80,000 man sieverts, or roughly 1/6 as much.<ref name="springerlink1">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5070vl7v843r063/ |title=Chernobyl — Limited health impacts - Springer |publisher= |date=1987-06-01 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}</ref>  However, some individuals, particular in areas adjacent the reactor, received significantly higher doses.

Chernobyl's radiation was detectable across Western Europe.  Average doses received ranged from 0.02 [[mrem]] ([[Portugal]]) to 38 mrem (portions of [[Germany]]).<ref name="springerlink1"/>

==Chernobyl compared with an atomic bomb==

Far fewer people died as an immediate result of the Chernobyl event than the immediate deaths [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|from radiation at Hiroshima]]. Chernobyl is eventually predicted to result in up to 4,000 total [[death]]s from cancers, sometime in the future, according to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and create ~ 41,000 excess cancers according to the [[International Journal of Cancer]], with, [[List of cancer mortality rates in the United States|depending on treatment]], not all cancers resulting in death.<ref>[http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/backgrounder/en/index.html Health effects of the Chernobyl accident: an overview]</ref><ref>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.22037/abstract Estimates of the cancer burden in Europe from radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident]</ref> Due to the differences in [[half-life]] the different [[radioactive]] [[fission products]] undergo [[exponential decay]] at different rates. Hence the isotopic signature of an event where more than one radioisotope is involved will change with time.

"Compared with other nuclear events: The Chernobyl explosion put 400 times more radioactive material into the Earth's atmosphere than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima; atomic weapons tests conducted in the 1950s and 1960s all together are estimated to have put some 100 to 1,000 times more radioactive material into the atmosphere than the Chernobyl accident." :This article is written in page 8(9) of "Ten years after Chernobyl:What do we really know? "of the PDF official document.<ref>http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/28/058/28058918.pdf</ref>

The radioactivity released at Chernobyl tended to be more long lived than that released by a bomb detonation hence it is not possible to draw a simple comparison between the two events.  Also, a dose of radiation spread over many years (as is the case with Chernobyl) is much less harmful than the same dose received over a short period.

The relative size of the Chernobyl release when compared with the release due to a hypothetical [[ground burst]] of a bomb similar to the [[Fat Man]] device dropped on Nagasaki.

The graph of dose rate as a function of time for the bomb fallout was done using a method similar to that of T. Imanaka, S. Fukutani, M. Yamamoto, A. Sakaguchi and M. Hoshi, ''J. Radiation Research'', 2006, '''47''', Suppl A121-A127. Our graph exhibits the same shape as that obtained in the paper. The bomb fallout graph is for a [[ground burst]] of an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion type weapon|implosion-based]] [[plutonium]] bomb which has a [[depleted uranium]] [[tamper]]. The fission was assumed to have been caused by 1 MeV neutrons and 20% occurred in the <sup>238</sup>U tamper of the bomb. It was assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that no [[Eruption column|plume]] separation of the [[isotopes]] occurred between the detonation and the deposit of [[radioactivity]]. The following gamma-emitting isotopes are modeled <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>133</sup>I, <sup>132</sup>Te, <sup>133</sup>I, <sup>135</sup>I, <sup>140</sup>Ba, <sup>95</sup>Zr, <sup>97</sup>Zr, <sup>99</sup>Mo, <sup>99m</sup>Tc, <sup>103</sup>Ru, <sup>105</sup>Ru, <sup>106</sup>Ru, <sup>142</sup>La, <sup>143</sup>Ce, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>91</sup>Y, <sup>91</sup>Sr, <sup>92</sup>Sr, <sup>128</sup>Sb and <sup>129</sup>Sb. The graph ignores the effects of beta emission and shielding. The data for the isotopes was obtained from the Korean table of the isotopes. The graphs for the Chernobyl accident were computed by an analogous method.

A [[ground burst]] of a nuclear weapon creates considerably more local deposited fallout than the [[air burst]]s used at Hiroshima or Nagasaki. This is due in part to [[Neutron activation]] of ground soil and greater amounts of soil being sucked into the nuclear fireball in a ground burst than in a high air burst. In the above [[neutron activation]] is neglected, and only the [[fission product]] fraction of the total [[becquerel|activity]] resulting from the ground burst is shown.

==Chernobyl compared with Tomsk-7==

The release of radioactivity which occurred at [[Tomsk-7]] (an industrial nuclear complex located in [[Seversk]] rather than the city of Tomsk) in 1993 is another comparison with the Chernobyl release. During  [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] activities, some of the feed for the second cycle (medium active part) of the [[PUREX]] process escaped in an accident involving [[red oil]]. According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] it was estimated that the following isotopes were released from the reaction vessel:<ref>[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PubDetAR.asp?pubId=4740 IAEA Publications - Details<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* <sup>106</sup>Ru 7.9 TBq
* <sup>103</sup>Ru 340 GBq
* <sup>95</sup>Nb 11.2 TBq
* <sup>95</sup>Zr 5.1 TBq
* ''<sup>137</sup>Cs 505 GBq'' (estimated from the IAEA data)
* <sup>141</sup>Ce 370 GBq
* <sup>144</sup>Ce 240 GBq
* <sup>125</sup>Sb 100 GBq
* <sup>239</sup>Pu 5.2 GBq

It is important to note that the very short lived isotopes such as <sup>140</sup>Ba and <sup>131</sup>I were absent from this mixture, and the long lived <sup>137</sup>Cs was only at a small concentration. This is because it is not able to enter the [[tributyl phosphate]]/[[hydrocarbon]] organic phase used in the first [[liquid-liquid extraction]] cycle of the PUREX process. The second cycle is normally to clean up the [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] product. In the PUREX process some [[zirconium]], [[technetium]] and other elements are extracted by the tributyl phosphate. Due to the radiation induced degradation of tributyl phosphate the first cycle organic phase is always contaminated with [[ruthenium]] (later extracted by dibutyl hydrogen phosphate). Because the very short lived radioisotopes '''and''' the relatively long lived caesium isotopes are either absent or in low concentrations the shape of the dose rate vs. time graph is different from Chernobyl both for short times and long times after the accident.

The size of the radioactive release at Tomsk-7 was much smaller, and while it caused moderate environmental contamination it did not cause any early [[death]]s.

==Chernobyl compared to Fukushima Daiichi==

==Chernobyl compared with the Goiânia accident==

While both events released <sup>137</sup>Cs, the isotopic signature for the [[Goiânia accident]] was much simpler.<ref>[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PubDetAR.asp?pubId=3684 IAEA Publications - Details<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was a single isotope which has a [[half-life]] of about 30 years. To show how the activity vs. time graph for a single isotope differs from the dose rate due to Chernobyl (in the open air) the following chart is shown with calculated data for a hypothetical release of <sup>106</sup>Ru.

==Chernobyl compared with the Three Mile Island accident==
{{Main|Three Mile Island accident}}

Three Mile Island-2 was an accident of a completely different type from Chernobyl.  Chernobyl was a design flaw-caused power excursion causing a steam explosion resulting in a graphite fire, uncontained, which lofted radioactive smoke high into the atmosphere; TMI was a slow, undetected leak that lowered the water level around the nuclear fuel, resulting in over a third of it shattering when refilled rapidly with coolant.  Unlike Chernobyl, TMI-2's reactor vessel did not fail and contained almost all of the radioactive material.  [[Containment building|Containment]] at TMI did not fail.  A small quantity of radioactive gases from the leak were vented into the atmosphere through specially designed filters under operator control.  A government report concluded that the accident caused no increase in cancer rates for local residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/stories/study090190.htm |title=Three Mile Island |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1990-09-01 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}</ref>

==Chernobyl compared with criticality accidents==

During the time between the start of the [[Manhattan project]] and the present day, a series of accidents have occurred in which nuclear criticality has played a central role. The criticality accidents may be divided into two classes. For more details see nuclear and radiation accidents. A review of the topic was published in 2000, [http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf "A Review of Criticality Accidents"] by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (Report LA-13638), May 2000. Coverage includes United States, Russia, United Kingdom, and Japan. Also available at [http://www.csirc.net/library/la_13638.shtml this page], which also tries to track down documents referenced in the report.

===Process accidents===
In the first class (process accidents) during the processing of [[fissile]] material, accidents have occurred when a [[critical mass]] has been created by accident. For instance at [[Charlestown, Rhode Island|Charlestown]], [[Rhode Island]], United States on July 24, 1964 one death occurred and at [[Tokaimura]], Japan, nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, on September 30, 1999<ref>[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf37.htm World Nuclear Association<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> two deaths and one non fatal overexposure occurred as result of accidents where too much fissile matter was placed in a vessel. These accidents tend to lead to very high doses due to direct [[irradiation]] of the workers within the site, but due to the [[inverse square law]] the dose suffered by members of the general public tends to be very small. Also very little environmental contamination normally occurs as a result of these accidents. A release of radioactivity occurred as a result of the Tokaimura event. The building in which the accident occurred was not designed as a containment building, yet it was able to retard the spread of radioactivity. Because the temperature rise in the nuclear reaction vessel was small, the majority of the [[fission products]] remained in the vessel.

===Reactor accidents===

In this type of accident a reactor or other critical assembly releases far more fission power than was expected, or it becomes critical at the wrong moment in time. The series of examples of such events include one in an experimental facility in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], on September 23, 1983 (one death)<ref>[http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1983/in83066s1.html NRC.gov]</ref> and during the [[Manhattan Project]] several people were irradiated (two, [[Harry K. Daghlian]] and [[Louis Slotin]], fatally) during "tickling the [[Demon core|dragon's tail]]" experiments. These accidents tend to lead to very high doses due to direct [[irradiation]] of the workers within the site, but due to the [[inverse square law]] the dose suffered by members of the [[general public]] tends to be very small. Also very little environmental contamination normally occurs as a result of these accidents. For instance at [[Sarov]] according to the [[IAEA]] report (2001)<ref>[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1106_scr.pdf The criticality accident in Sarov]</ref> the radioactivity remained confined to within the [[actinide]] metal objects which were part of the experimental system. Even the [[SL-1]] accident failed to release much radioactivity outside the building in which it occurred.
